# Static Comp 2

This is the third CSS-heavy project I completed at Turing, during the final weeks of Mod 1. The goal was to match the style of the provided comp as closely as possible, with some latitude given to the content itself. We were also asked to incorporate media queries and test for responsiveness on various screen sizes. Grid was especially useful for this project, and my main strategy was to use grid for the larger elements of the page and a combination of grid and flexbox for the smaller elements.

I struggled a bit with the checkboxes (which involved pushing the actual checkbockes off the screen and creating "fake" ones that appeared in the right spot) and the circle graphs, as I haven't had any practice with svgs. I wound up scrapping my initial attempts in both of these areas and starting from scratch. I look forward to learning more about svgs next.
 
A dumb problem I'm having is that I can't figure out how to take a screenshot of my entire page (including what's "below the fold") and because a media query kicks in pretty early to hide the nav bar, I've taken three separate screenshots to capture the length of the page. I can't seem to find the screenshot option in the dev tools that will make this easier, but I hope I'll have that sorted out by the next project.

And here's the comp we were asked to match.
